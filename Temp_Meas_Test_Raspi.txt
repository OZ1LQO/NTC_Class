Welcome to the Rasperry PI NTC Thermistor demo!
Updated 2014.05.29 to use the newly made NTC Class/Library.
This demo shows how to use a linearized NTC Thermistor to measure the temperature.
See the calculation spreadsheet to learn about the linearization calculations.
You have to select the power supply for the sensor circuit, after that,
the script will do 10 successive measurements.
Have fun!!

What do you want, 1: 3.3V supply or 2: 5V 1
Hi, I'm an NTC Thermistor. These are my parameters:
B Value:3470.0
Nominal Value(kOhm):10.0
Nominal Temperature(C):25.0


Doing a temperature measurement with the values:

Rlin= 2  kOhm

Rs= 2.2  kOhm

Vs= 3.3 Volts
