NTC_Class
=========

A Py3 toolbox to handle NTC Thermistor measurement with an ADC.
You'll find the library, a script to test all the functionality,
a spreadsheet with all my sims and calcs, and a small schematic on
how to set up a temperature sensor circuit.

See my other repository on RasPI NTC DAC handling, to get an idea on
how to use it. That one is made in Py2.7 tho.. haven't re-written the
ADC libraries to py3 yet (if nescessary..)

Have fun!!
