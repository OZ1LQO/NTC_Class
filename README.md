NTC_Class
=========

A Py3 toolbox to handle NTC Thermistor measurement with an ADC.
You'll find the library, a script to test all the functionality,
a spreadsheet with all my sims and calcs, and a small schematic on
how to set up a temperature sensor circuit.

See my other repository on RasPI NTC DAC handling, to get an idea on
how to use it. 

UPDATE - Just ported the library to Python 2.7 and tested it live on my 
RasPI, using an ADC from Abelectronics. Works fine.
Updated the repo with some sample code for RasPI and the ADC along with a
screenshot of a sample run :-)


Have fun!!
